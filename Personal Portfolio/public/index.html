            Hi! I'm Lyra Lee.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an innovator who can scrutinize the reality and transform the solution, converting ideas to impact for
            the benefit of all.
        </p>
        <p>
            I walked into Computer Science through my educational service for the disabled, after one of my students
            said, “I dream of becoming a programmer.” The service usually involves teaching basic IT skills such as
            Microsoft Office, but I went beyond to prepare our own class materials with Scratch and Entry. Even though
            her intellectual disability hindered her learning, her satisfaction upon getting a taste of coding drove me
            further to take responsibility and spend ample time thoroughly understanding the codes so I would be fully
            prepared to teach them.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is when I gradually saw myself intrigued by the infinite capabilities of
            coding, with an insatiable curiosity and urge to expand across diverse languages and extend my skills.
